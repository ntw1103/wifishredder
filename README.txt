Wifi Shredder is supposed to clear all the saved wifi profiles 
from your android device at the press of a button.

Possible future additions? 
- white listed wifi profiles, so it doesn’t wipe out your home network profile.
- automatically run when a network loses connection to a network. (will need to make the service not eat battery)
